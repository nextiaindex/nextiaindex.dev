## What is Codeberg?
Codeberg is another version of GitHub powered by Forgejo.

## Why I'm using Codeberg?
GitHub is awesome with their exclusive features. For example:
- <strong>Forks</strong>. I can flex my forked repository to make me look like an experienced programmer although I'm not.
- <strong>Packages</strong>. This is the best way to host your binary files. Just upload them in Packages.
- <strong>Pinned repositories</strong>. I can make my GitHub profile page more cool with this.
- <strong>Feeds</strong>. I can watch what my friends are up to.

But the things that bothers me are their advertisements, and quite terrible UX. If you open GitHub homepage, things that you see first is AI and other advertisements, and then the Feeds.
In Codeberg, the first thing that you will see is your Git status and activities. Very nice.

My principle when using tools is to get the job done. It all started with "I want to host my Git repositories", GitHub is the answer. And then, "I love GitHub, but I hate the ads", Codeberg is the answer.

## Even I'm using Codeberg mainly, I will still use GitHub
GitHub ecosystem is really nice. There are a lot of tools that supports GitHub. For example, Netlify. This site is hosted with Netlify. I haven't found great replacement to Netlify.
