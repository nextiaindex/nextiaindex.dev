title: Don't ask to ask, just ask
---
Everytime I'm visiting or idling in some online community, there is always a person who asks like this:

`Any experts around here?`


instead of just being straight to their point. This is a bad practice that still continues for everyday.

<br>

The proper way to ask a question is to provide:
- What are you trying to achieve.
- Your attempt when you tried to achieve your goal. (Optional)

## Example:

`How do I make navigation bar in HTML?`

`How to fix computer fan that is hissing louder than the usual? I have restarted my computer and its still hissing very loud.`

Time is precious, people are busy. When you ask a question, you are indirectly asking your helper to take the responsibility and commiting to you until your problem is solved. People in the internet have their own life too.

When writing a question, you need to put more effort to it. When you did, people will know that you are actually trying your best to fight your problem.

If you refuse to be serious about your problem, they will also refuse to be serious to help you.
