			<h1>How to read efficiently</h1>
			<h2>What is reading?</h2>
<p>Reading is the process to understand information from text and signs. Everyone must be already know how to read. But unfortunately, I feel like everyone is not doing it properly. When you don't read properly, the information will not be stored inside your memory. They just fly through your head and then disappears.</p>
<h2>What does &quot;efficient&quot; mean according to me?</h2>
<p>Efficient means doing it without unnecessary steps that has nothing to do with your goal. The goal of reading is to understand information. If you are not reading efficiently, it will be much harder for you to understand the information from what are you reading.</p>
<br>
<h2>Enough for the back story, here are the tricks of how to read efficiently</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ask when you don't understand.</strong> When reading something, you will stumbled upon sentences that feels really hard to understand. If you cannot understand something, ask it to someone that is better than you. It can be the person who have already finished what are you reading, your teacher, your parents, etcetera. You can also ask it to the author, if you want to.</li>
<li><strong>Choose what do you like.</strong> Reading should be something to be enjoyed, not something to be forced (except your school assignment or looking for something). Instead of reading something complex that you don't even really like the content inside, you should pick reading content that picked your interest.</li>
<li><strong>Write them.</strong> After reading it, you should write them. When you are writing it, your brain will try their best to recall what did you just read. This process will not only improve your understanding, but also memorize the information.</li>
<li><strong>Share your writing.</strong> There are so many ways to do this. My suggestion would be sharing them in your own blog website or give your notes to people who you know.</li>
</ol>
