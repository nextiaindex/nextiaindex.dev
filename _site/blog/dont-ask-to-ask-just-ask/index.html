			<h1>Don't ask to ask, just ask</h1>
			<p>Everytime I'm visiting or idling in some online community, there is always a person who asks like this:</p>
<p><code>Any experts around here?</code></p>
<p>instead of just being straight to their point. This is a bad practice that still continues for everyday.</p>
<br>
<p>The proper way to ask a question is to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are you trying to achieve.</li>
<li>Your attempt when you tried to achieve your goal. (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><code>How do I make navigation bar in HTML?</code></p>
<p><code>How to fix computer fan that is hissing louder than the usual? I have restarted my computer and its still hissing very loud.</code></p>
<br>

<p>Time is precious, people are busy. When you ask a question, you are indirectly asking your helper to take the responsibility and commiting to you until your problem is solved. People in the internet have their own life too.</p>
<p>When writing a question, you need to put more effort to it. When you did, people will know that you are actually trying your best to fight your problem.</p>
<p>If you refuse to be serious about your problem, they will also refuse to be serious to help you.</p>
