<h1>Hi, Welcome to my website</h1>
<p>I go by "NextiaIndex" pen name. I went from reading textbooks as a natural science prodigy to writing configuration files as a Linux ricing artist.</p>
<p>This website is my place to describe myself and write my thoughts. It can be Linux, it can be a book that I just finished reading, it can be anything.</p>

<h1>My Latest Blog</h1>
